# Using a Person Sensor on a Raspberry Pi Pico

Example code that shows how to interface the Raspberry Pi Pico to [Useful 
Sensor's](https://usefulsensors.com) Person 
Sensor board over I2C.

## Introduction

The Person Sensor is a small hardware module that's intended to make it easy to
find out when people are near a device, where they are, and who they are. It has
an image sensor and a microcontroller with pretrained ML models that use
computer vision to spot faces. 

There's a [detailed developer guide](https://usfl.ink/ps_dev)
available, but this project has sample code that shows you specifically how to 
get the sensor up and running with a Raspberry Pi Pico using C.

## Building

Make sure that you're able to build and run the standard Raspberry Pi Pico
examples, like `blink`. You can find general instructions on this in the 
[Pico Getting Started Guide](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf),
and [here's a Colab notebook that might help](https://usfl.ink/pico_blink_colab).
The main issues to watch out for are ensuring that `PICO_SDK_PATH` is set as an
environment variable, and points to the right location.

Once you're ready, run the following commands from within this repository's
folder to create the build files:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

After that succeeds, you should be able to run the compilation stage:

```bash
make
```

There should now be a binary at `build/face_detection_example.utf2`. You can
install this on your Pico board, though it won't work until you wire up the
sensor to the right pins.

## Wiring information

Wiring up the device requires 4 jumpers, to connect VDD, GND, SDA and SCL. The 
example here uses I2C port 0, which is assigned to GPIO4 (SDA, pin 6) and GPIO5
(SCL, pin 7) in software. Power is supplied from 3V3(OUT) (pin 36), with ground
attached to GND (pin 38).

Follow the wiring scheme shown below:

If you're using [Qwiic connectors](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic), the colors 
will be black for GND, red for 3.3V, blue for SDA, and yellow for SDC.

## Running Face Detection

Once you have the sensor wired up, connect the Pico over USB while holding the
`bootsel` button to mount it as a storage device, copy the 
`face_detection_example.utf2` file over to it, and it should begin running. To 
see the logging output you'll need to set up `minicom` or a similar tool. Once
that is done, you should start to see information about the faces it spots, or
error messages. If you hold the sensor so that it's pointing at your own face
you should see output like this:
```
********
1 faces found
Face #0: 99 confidence, (68, 71), 136x193, facing      
```
This shows that the sensor has found one face, with a 136 by 193 bounding box,
with the top-left corner at 68, 71, and the head is pointing directly towards
the sensor.

## Troubleshooting

### Power

The first thing to check is that the sensor is receiving power through the
`VDD` and `GND` wires. The simplest way to test this is to hold the sensor
upright (so the I2C connector is at the top) and point it at your face. You
should see a green LED light up. If you don't see any response from the LED then
it's likely the sensor isn't receiving power, so check those wires are set up
correctly.

### Communication

If you see connection errors when running the face detection example, you may
have an issue with your wiring. To help track down what's going wrong, you can
copy over the `scan_i2c.utf2` file to the board, and this will display which
I2C devices are available in the logs. Here's an example from a board that's set
up correctly:

```
00 .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .                       
10 .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .                       
20 .  .  .  .  @  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .                       
30 .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  @  .  .  .  .  .  .                       
40 .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  @                       
50 .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .                       
60 .  .  @  .  .  .  .  .  @  .  .  .  .  .  .  .                       
70 .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
```

The important entry is the first `@` shown on line starting with `60`. This
indicates that there's a response on the address `0x62`, which is the fixed
location of the person sensor. If the `@` isn't present at this point in the
grid then it means the sensor isn't responding to I2C messages as it should be.
The most likely cause is that there's a wiring problem, so if you hit this you
should double-check that the SDA and SCL wires are going to the right pins.

## Running Face Recognition

As well as detecting the locations of faces, the sensor is also capable of
recognizing people's identities. This requires code that's a bit more involved
than simple detection, and you can find the example program in
[`face_recognition_example.c`](https://github.com/usefulsensors/person_sensor_pico_c/blob/main/face_recognition_example.c).
To try it out, build the project and copy over `face_recognition_example.utf2`
to the board. If you hold the sensor up to your own face you should initially
see output like this:
```
********                                                                         
1 faces found                                                                           
Unrecognized face 0 
```

If you hold the sensor in place for a few seconds, you should see a log message
saying `Calibrating`, followed by `Done calibrating`. You should now have
taught the sensor to recognize your own face, and the output should change to
something like:
```
********
1 faces found
Recognized face 0 as person 1 with confidence 99
```
If you now go through the same procedure with another face (finding a
celebrity's face on a web page will do if you don't have a volunteer handy) you
should start to see that person recognized as person #2 when you point the
sensor back at it after calibration.

This recognition algorithm is not accurate enough to be used for security
applications like unlocking a device, but we're hoping it will be useful for
projects that need to personalize their interface for particular people. One
to thing to watch out for is the confidence value, you need to have it in the
90's to have a reasonable expectation that a match has been found.

## Writing your own Applications

Hopefully the example code shown here should give you a good starting point for
using the sensor in your own projects, but you can see more details about the
interface in [`person_sensor.h`](https://github.com/usefulsensors/person_sensor_pico_c/blob/main/person_sensor.h).
This header contains the data structures used to return information from the
peripheral, and functions to read and configure the device.
If you are trying to port this code to a different board, you can check the
[developer guide](https://usfl.ink/ps_dev) to see if there's already support for
your platform, and if not, the main differences are likely to be in the I2C
initialization, reading, and writing implementations. If you can find examples
of how to do the I2C bus setup on the new board, and then equivalents to the
`i2c_read_blocking` and `i2c_write_blocking` functions, you should be able to
reuse the rest of the data structures and logic.
